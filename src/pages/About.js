                        The Right Fluff is family-owned, a true small business
                        dedicated to bringing smiles to faces of all ages. After
                        all, few treats are as ageless and timeless as cotton
                        candy. And we couldn’t think of a more fun way to spread
                        a little joy to our community while teaching our own
                        kids about business.

                        But there’s more to the story. As parents of a child
                        with food sensitivities, we were heartbroken when she
                        couldn’t enjoy something as simple and fun as a cone of
                        cotton candy at the county fair. That got us thinking:
                        How many other kids (or kids at heart) deny themselves
                        such simple pleasures?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That’s why our twist on a traditional treat is made with
                        dye-free, all-natural flavors blended into a base of
                        organic sugar that is guaranteed to bring back as many
                        memories as it will create new ones.
